        <section class="article-content">
            <p>Artificial intelligence is not just a far-off idea; it is already changing the way businesses hire people. Our analytical team oversaw <a href="https://resumewritinglab.com/blog/ai-algorithms-and-your-future-job/">a poll</a> of 2,000 job seekers between the ages of 22 and 54 in order to learn how applicants view artificial intelligence in hiring.</p>
            <h2>Mixed Feelings About AI's Role in Hiring</h2>
            <p>In our study, 25% of participants had doubts regarding AI's ability to evaluate job seekers fairly, but 51% of respondents had a favorable opinion of the technology. At the same time, two out of three respondents were satisfied with the assessment they received from artificial intelligence, considering it fair and free from biased judgment. This is similar to how people often relate to horoscopes, taking vague descriptions as if they perfectly fit their own situation.</p>
            <p>I often notice a paradox that people keep consulting AI about work or important matters, even when it makes mistakes or contradicts itself. The paradox can be explained by the fact that people perceive artificial intelligence as something objective, free from doubts and the subjective qualities that influence human judgment.</p>
            <p>Many of us have experienced job rejections after interviews and often attributed them to an interviewer's arrogance or personal bias - a problem AI is expected to overcome. However, shortcomings still exist, as 12% of respondents even reported facing gender discrimination from AI.</p>
            <h2>The Speed Factor - and Ghosting Concerns</h2>
            <p>Speed is one of the most obvious indicators that AI is used in hiring. 72% of respondents concluded that they were satisfied with the speed of responses, as it helped them avoid waiting too long for a reply, move on to searching for a new job after receiving a rejection, or start preparing for an interview after a positive outcome.</p>
            <p>We can never be certain that our resume was reviewed by a professional recruiter, nor that recruiters will actually attend the interviews scheduled by AI. This can become a real challenge for unprepared job seekers, as many interviews may never take place simply because they were arranged by artificial intelligence.</p>
            <p>Sarah, 32, shared her frustration:</p>
            <blockquote>
                <a>“I’ve been ghosted 50 times this year because recruiters didn't show up for interviews that AI had scheduled.”</a>
            </blockquote>
            <p>On the other hand, one in three respondents received no response at all. In the future, they would not know whether they could move on or should continue waiting for feedback.</p>
            <p>Ben, 37, shared another story: <i>“I expected that my resume would at least reach a recruiter, but it didn't - I was rejected just minutes after applying.”</i></p>
            <h2>Reapplying Despite AI Barriers</h2>
            <p>42% said they would reapply to companies that did not provide feedback the first time. This level of persistence demonstrates an impressive degree of determination.</p>
            <p>Job seekers try to learn how to “speak the language” of AI in order to bypass its algorithms and secure their desired position.</p>
            <p>42% of respondents stated they would prefer professional help navigating these filters, and nearly 47% indicated using job posting keywords to capture AI's attention.</p>
            <p>Dan, 28, explained: <i>“I often use artificial intelligence to tailor my resume and cover letter to match job descriptions.”</i></p>
            <h2>Data Privacy and AI Anxiety</h2>
            <p>Over half of the respondents said they were confident AI wouldn't exploit their personal information when asked about data security. I was struck by the fact that 21% of respondents had never considered or worried about the possibility that artificial intelligence might misuse the information provided in their resumes.</p>
            <h2>Fears About the Future of Work</h2>
            <p>Recruiters aren’t the only ones who fear that AI might take their jobs in the future (even though they are among the first at risk). Our study revealed that one in four respondents shares these concerns</p>
            <p>Mark, 43, told us: <i>“I am worried that AI will gradually replace human workers, with businesses assigning more and more tasks to machines.”</i></p>
            <h2>My Takeaway as a Career Expert</h2>
            <p>I perceive a dilemma in this study. Through the use of keywords, CV customization, and even the use of AI technologies itself, job seekers are learning to adjust to AI. However, they still yearn for justice, openness, and interpersonal relationships.</p>
            <p>Balance is key to hiring in the future. Instead of replacing empathy, technology should increase efficiency. A business will stand out in the job market and build stronger connections with candidates if it integrates the capabilities of artificial intelligence under the strict supervision of professional recruiters.</p>
